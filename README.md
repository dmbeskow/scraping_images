# scraping_images

This code is a collection of code that I used for scraping images from a variety of locations (Google images, Flickr, Tumblr, Twitter, and Instagram).

I used these platforms to collect images for training a Convolutional Neural Network model.  

### Google

See example code

### Twitter

See example code (assumes that you have one or more JSON files that you want to extract images from).  This code will skip download if Twitter flags tweet as sensitive.

### Instagram

See https://github.com/althonos/InstaLooter


My Command:
```
instalooter hashtag meme img -n 1000
```

### Flickr

See example code

### Tumblr

I used an R Package (private repo...sorry) that I developed in the past.
